# Contributing & Engagement Guidelines

This repository is primarily documentation-driven and reflects how I approach ownership of production AI systems.

## Purpose
The intent is to demonstrate decision-making, reliability thinking, and system design under real-world constraints rather than provide a reusable library or framework.

## Engagement Expectations
- Discussions should focus on architecture, failure modes, and trade-offs
- Suggestions should respect existing constraints (infrastructure, OAuth, integrations)
- Changes are considered only when they improve stability, clarity, or scalability

## How I Prefer to Work
- Clear problem statements over vague requests
- Written decisions and rationale
- Production impact considered before implementation
- Minimal process, maximum signal

## Contributions
Code contributions are not expected.  
Constructive discussion and thoughtful feedback are welcome.

Thank you for reviewing.
